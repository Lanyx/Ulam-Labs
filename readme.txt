This is a demo program concentrating on the documentation aspect of coding.
I have been challenged to design the API-end points for an online store. This
program has done that, but mostly in the comments. All the routines are empty
shells (with a 'pass') instruction.

However, the documentation has been written into the code as a docstring. It was
extracted with a tool into the static http page.

I added my personal comments and technical experience as "Architect's Notes".
I hope that this meets the task requirements.
