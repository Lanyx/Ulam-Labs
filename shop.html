I ran into some irony. I was trying to get a professional look to the

Then, I found a gem named &#39;pdoc&#39;. (I like the Ruby language, hence the

def list_products(dBriefcase):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Returns information about items available for purchase in the shop.

    Method looks through the database based on the search and indexing
    parameters provided. A structure is then returned. Note that error handling
    is incoperated into the response.

    Parameters
    ----------
        dBriefcase (dictionary)
        This is an all-in-one container for transporting variables into the
        method. The keys required are listed below:

            dBriefcase[&#34;iIdx&#34;] (integer)
                Index to the paginated data. It is used to break up a long
                list into smaller pieces. For example, if there are 314 items
                for a particular keyword, the caller may want to fetch in
                batches of 5. &#39;iIdx&#39; will be set to 0 for the first batch and
                to 4 for the second, and so on.

            dBriefcase[&#34;iMax_res&#34;] (integer)
                Maximum number of results in this output.

            dBriefcase[&#34;sItem_filter&#34;] (string, none)
                (string) datatype:
                    Keyword for searching the &#39;description&#39; fields of products
                (none) datatype:
                    Show all products.

    Returns - Valid data
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification. The &#39;sStatus&#39; key is
    common to both &#39;valid data&#39; and &#39;error&#39; returns. It determines the further
    structure of the response

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput[&#34;sStatus&#34;] = &#34;OK&#34;
            The string &#34;OK&#34; is returned under the &#34;sStatus&#34; key, to indicate
            that non-error data is available.

        dOutput[&#34;iIdx_n&#34;] (integer)
            Actual index, within the specified search, to the last item
            returned. If incremented, it can be used as the &#39;dBriefcase[&#34;idx&#34;]&#39;
            input in the next search to retrieve the next batch of items.

        dOutput[&#34;iSearch_tot&#34;] (integer)
            Total number of items in the search

        dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;] (list of dictionaries)
            Information about items requested. Each item in the list has the
            following structure. The &#39;n&#39; (integer) in the structure indexes the
            item number on the list

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sItem_id&#34;] (string)
                Unique item identifier as a string. May be a sequential
                alpha-numeric code.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sBrand&#34;] (string)
                Manufacturer name.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sDesc&#34;] (string)
                Searchable item description

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sSize&#34;] (string)
                If items are available in varous sizes (for example clothing,
                TV&#39;s) then a string is specifed.
                If the item is a &#39;one-size-fits-all&#39;, then the string &#39;N/A&#39;
                is used (&#39;Not applicable&#39;)

                So, &#34;blue jeans size 38&#34; will have a seperate entry to &#34;blue
                jeans size 36&#34;. Also &#34;black jeans size 38&#34; will also be
                seperate.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sColour&#34;] (string)
                Main colour or pattern of the item.

                So, &#34;blue jeans size 38&#34; will have a seperate entry to &#34;black
                jeans size 38&#34;. Also &#34;blue jeans size 38&#34; will also be
                seperate.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;fPrice&#34;] (float)
                Price of the item in the &#34;sCurrency&#34; (see below) units.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sCurrency&#34;] (string)
                ISO-4217 currency code, in which the item is priced. For
                example, the Polish Zloty has the code &#34;PLN&#34;. The string &#34;PLN&#34;
                would be entered in this field

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;iStock&#34;] (integer)
                How many items are currently available for purchase.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;aPhotos&#34;] (list of strings)
                Links to photos of the item

    Returns -- Error output
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification.

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput[&#34;sStatus&#34;] = &#34;ERROR&#34;
            The string &#34;ERROR&#34; is returned under the &#34;sStatus&#34; key, to indicate
            that error information is available.

        dOutput[&#34;sErr_desc&#34;] (string)
            Brief description of the error.

            &#34;data validation&#34;: Incorrectly formatted input

            &#34;item not found&#34;: Search yielded 0 results

            &#34;connection error&#34;: Unable to reach the database

            &#34;internal error&#34;: reserved for an error which could not be
                predicted at the design stage.

    Raises (exceptions)

    pass
    # TODO: Add code here.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def create_order(sAuth_token):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Indicates the intention for the customer to make purchaces.

    Method validates the authentication token (to make sure that is hasn&#39;t
    expired). Internally, a &#39;basket&#39; is opened under this authentication code.

    Architect&#39;s Note:\n
    I would place the customer authentication at this step. The customer would
    be free to browse the shop without any authentication. However, when it
    comes to a financial transaction, we need authentication. Since I don&#39;t
    understand the difference between &#39;create order&#39; and &#39;update order&#39;, I made
    a few assumptions.
    Anyway, In my revised model, I would take in (in the briefcase): the user
    name, the salt of their password. Two level authentication can be done at
    the checkout stage (confirmation via SMS or another channel)

    Parameters
    ----------
        sAuth_token (string)
        Expiring cryptographic token generated during authentication.
            # Architect&#39;s Note:
            # Since the token expires within about 30 minutes, then I believe
            # that AES or triple-DES encryption should be sufficient. The token
            # can be encoded in base-62 (0..9,A..Z,a..z). Going RSA I think
            # would be overkill. However, the RSA option could be open as a
            # future security upgrade. If the traffic is lighter, then a simple
            # random number could be implemented.

    Returns - Valid data:
    --------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification. The &#39;sStatus&#39; key is
    common to both &#39;valid data&#39; and &#39;error&#39; returns. It determines the further
    structure of the response

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput[&#34;sStatus&#34;] = &#34;OK&#34;
            A string &#34;OK&#34; is returned as the value to the key &#34;OK&#34;. This is a
            flag to indicate that the request was successful.

        dOutput[&#34;sBasket_code&#34;] (string)
            Cryptographic identifier to which &#34;basket&#34; to use.
            # Architect&#39;s Note:
            # Internally, the &#39;basket&#39; will have the authentication code
            # attached to it. At check-out, the authentication will be checked
            # again.

    Returns - Error output:
    -------
    A dictionary is returned, which has one common key with the &#39;Valid data&#39;
    return option.

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput[&#34;sStatus&#34;] = &#34;ERROR&#34;
            The string &#34;ERROR&#34; is populated to flag the condition.

        Single-use cryptographic code which joins items purchased with the
        purchaser

            # Architect&#39;s Note: I try not to repeat definitions which were used
            # in a previous field. From experience, it is always helpful to have
            # multiple definitions of a certain item. Also, not every person&#39;s
            # English is good. Alternative descriptions will assist in a better
            # understanding of the concept.

    Returns - Valid data:
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure

    structure of the response\n
    Architect&#39;s Note: I have deliberately avoided adding up the totals, adding
    delivery, ect. Psychologically, the client would see the &#39;high&#39; bill and
    stop shopping. Hence, the surprises and the tax breakdown will be only
    revealed at the final invoice.

        Index to the paginated data. It is used to break up a long
        list into smaller pieces. For example, if there are 314 items
        for a particular keyword, the caller may want to fetch in
        batches of 5. 'iIdx' will be set to 0 for the first batch and
        to 4 for the second, and so on.

    dBriefcase["iMax_res"] (integer)
        Maximum number of results in this output.

    dBriefcase["sItem_filter"] (string, none)
        (string) datatype:

dOutput["iIdx_n"] (integer)
    Actual index, within the specified search, to the last item
    returned. If incremented, it can be used as the 'dBriefcase["idx"]'
    input in the next search to retrieve the next batch of items.

dOutput["iSearch_tot"] (integer)
    Total number of items in the search

dOutput["aItems"] (list of dictionaries)
    Information about items requested. Each item in the list has the
    following structure. The 'n' (integer) in the structure indexes the
    item number on the list

    dOutput["aItems"][n]["sItem_id"] (string)
        Unique item identifier as a string. May be a sequential
        alpha-numeric code.

    dOutput["aItems"][n]["sBrand"] (string)
        Manufacturer name.

    dOutput["aItems"][n]["sDesc"] (string)
        Searchable item description

    dOutput["aItems"][n]["sSize"] (string)
        If items are available in varous sizes (for example clothing,
        TV's) then a string is specifed.
        If the item is a 'one-size-fits-all', then the string 'N/A'
        is used ('Not applicable')

        So, "blue jeans size 38" will have a seperate entry to "blue
        jeans size 36". Also "black jeans size 38" will also be
        seperate.

    dOutput["aItems"][n]["sColour"] (string)

        dBriefcase (dictionary)
        This is an all-in-one container for transporting variables into the
        method. The keys required are listed below:

            dBriefcase[&#34;iIdx&#34;] (integer)
                Index to the paginated data. It is used to break up a long
                list into smaller pieces. For example, if there are 314 items
                for a particular keyword, the caller may want to fetch in
                batches of 5. &#39;iIdx&#39; will be set to 0 for the first batch and
                to 4 for the second, and so on.

            dBriefcase[&#34;iMax_res&#34;] (integer)
                Maximum number of results in this output.

            dBriefcase[&#34;sItem_filter&#34;] (string, none)
                (string) datatype:
                    Keyword for searching the &#39;description&#39; fields of products
                (none) datatype:
                    Show all products.

    Returns - Valid data
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification. The &#39;sStatus&#39; key is
    common to both &#39;valid data&#39; and &#39;error&#39; returns. It determines the further
    structure of the response

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput[&#34;sStatus&#34;] = &#34;OK&#34;
            The string &#34;OK&#34; is returned under the &#34;sStatus&#34; key, to indicate
            that non-error data is available.

        dOutput[&#34;iIdx_n&#34;] (integer)
            Actual index, within the specified search, to the last item
            returned. If incremented, it can be used as the &#39;dBriefcase[&#34;idx&#34;]&#39;
            input in the next search to retrieve the next batch of items.

        dOutput[&#34;iSearch_tot&#34;] (integer)
            Total number of items in the search

        dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;] (list of dictionaries)
            Information about items requested. Each item in the list has the
            following structure. The &#39;n&#39; (integer) in the structure indexes the
            item number on the list

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sItem_id&#34;] (string)
                Unique item identifier as a string. May be a sequential
                alpha-numeric code.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sBrand&#34;] (string)
                Manufacturer name.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sDesc&#34;] (string)
                Searchable item description

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sSize&#34;] (string)
                If items are available in varous sizes (for example clothing,
                TV&#39;s) then a string is specifed.
                If the item is a &#39;one-size-fits-all&#39;, then the string &#39;N/A&#39;
                is used (&#39;Not applicable&#39;)

                So, &#34;blue jeans size 38&#34; will have a seperate entry to &#34;blue
                jeans size 36&#34;. Also &#34;black jeans size 38&#34; will also be
                seperate.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sColour&#34;] (string)
                Main colour or pattern of the item.

                So, &#34;blue jeans size 38&#34; will have a seperate entry to &#34;black
                jeans size 38&#34;. Also &#34;blue jeans size 38&#34; will also be
                seperate.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;fPrice&#34;] (float)
                Price of the item in the &#34;sCurrency&#34; (see below) units.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;sCurrency&#34;] (string)
                ISO-4217 currency code, in which the item is priced. For
                example, the Polish Zloty has the code &#34;PLN&#34;. The string &#34;PLN&#34;
                would be entered in this field

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;iStock&#34;] (integer)
                How many items are currently available for purchase.

            dOutput[&#34;aItems&#34;][n][&#34;aPhotos&#34;] (list of strings)
                Links to photos of the item

    Returns -- Error output
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification.

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput[&#34;sStatus&#34;] = &#34;ERROR&#34;
            The string &#34;ERROR&#34; is returned under the &#34;sStatus&#34; key, to indicate
            that error information is available.

        dOutput[&#34;sErr_desc&#34;] (string)
            Brief description of the error.
