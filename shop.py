# pdoc --html --force shop.py

""" # Recruitment task for Ulam Labs (WrocÅ‚aw, Poland) prepared by Grzegorz Wochlik
    wochlik.gm@gmail.com
-----
Dummy program concentrating on design and documentation of the API end points.

I ran into some irony. I was trying to get a professional look to the
documentation, rather than the cut-and-paste text file output. I looked for some
tools like 'sphinx' and 'mkdoc'. The irony is that tools to aid with
documentation were so poorly documented that they were unusable. Also, they
didn't do their job properly.

Then, I found a gem named 'pdoc'. (I like the Ruby language, hence the
reference). This tool is no fuss, no nonsense. The single example gets right to
the point. The additional parameter ('--force') was easy to find. It overwrites
the current HTML file.

Pass or fail, as ususal, I made a {mountain from a molehill}*; this project was
an interesting experience. It opened my eyes to an alternative career path as a
"Software Architect" (I thank You for that). Effectively, my little bit of
knowledge about everything becomes useful. Additionally, this experience has
re-affirmed my values: preference to morning work instead of evening,
constant editing to make sure it is perfect, constant stopping to think 'is
this correct?', the testing after every paragraph. The grand final, the grand
discovery: I still can't fit into a time budget.

As you can clearly see, I also have a passion for writing. Well, here I am
{opening a can of worms}*. Anyway, I'll need to move onto technical matters.

def list_products(dBriefcase):
    """Returns information about items available for purchase in the shop.

    Method looks through the database based on the search and indexing
    parameters provided. A structure is then returned. Note that error handling
    is incoperated into the response.

    Parameters
    ----------
        dBriefcase (dictionary)
        This is an all-in-one container for transporting variables into the
        method. The keys required are listed below:

            dBriefcase["iIdx"] (integer)
                Index to the paginated data. It is used to break up a long
                list into smaller pieces. For example, if there are 314 items
                for a particular keyword, the caller may want to fetch in
                batches of 5. 'iIdx' will be set to 0 for the first batch and
                to 4 for the second, and so on.

            dBriefcase["iMax_res"] (integer)
                Maximum number of results in this output.

            dBriefcase["sItem_filter"] (string, none)
                (string) datatype:
                    Keyword for searching the 'description' fields of products
                (none) datatype:
                    Show all products.

    Returns - Valid data
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification. The 'sStatus' key is
    common to both 'valid data' and 'error' returns. It determines the further
    structure of the response

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput["sStatus"] = "OK"
            The string "OK" is returned under the "sStatus" key, to indicate
            that non-error data is available.

        dOutput["iIdx_n"] (integer)
            Actual index, within the specified search, to the last item
            returned. If incremented, it can be used as the 'dBriefcase["idx"]'
            input in the next search to retrieve the next batch of items.

        dOutput["iSearch_tot"] (integer)
            Total number of items in the search

        dOutput["aItems"] (list of dictionaries)
            Information about items requested. Each item in the list has the
            following structure. The 'n' (integer) in the structure indexes the
            item number on the list

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["sItem_id"] (string)
                Unique item identifier as a string. May be a sequential
                alpha-numeric code.

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["sBrand"] (string)
                Manufacturer name.

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["sDesc"] (string)
                Searchable item description

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["sSize"] (string)
                If items are available in varous sizes (for example clothing,
                TV's) then a string is specifed.
                If the item is a 'one-size-fits-all', then the string 'N/A'
                is used ('Not applicable')

                So, "blue jeans size 38" will have a seperate entry to "blue
                jeans size 36". Also "black jeans size 38" will also be
                seperate.

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["sColour"] (string)
                Main colour or pattern of the item.

                So, "blue jeans size 38" will have a seperate entry to "black
                jeans size 38". Also "blue jeans size 38" will also be
                seperate.

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["fPrice"] (float)
                Price of the item in the "sCurrency" (see below) units.

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["sCurrency"] (string)
                ISO-4217 currency code, in which the item is priced. For
                example, the Polish Zloty has the code "PLN". The string "PLN"
                would be entered in this field

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["iStock"] (integer)
                How many items are currently available for purchase.

            dOutput["aItems"][n]["aPhotos"] (list of strings)
                Links to photos of the item

    Returns -- Error output
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification.

    dOutput (dictionary)

        dOutput["sStatus"] = "ERROR"
            The string "ERROR" is returned under the "sStatus" key, to indicate
            that error information is available.

        dOutput["sErr_desc"] (string)
            Brief description of the error.

            "data validation": Incorrectly formatted input

            "item not found": Search yielded 0 results

            "connection error": Unable to reach the database

    Method validates the authentication token (to make sure that is hasn't

    Architect's Note:\n
    I would place the customer authentication at this step. The customer would
    be free to browse the shop without any authentication. However, when it
    comes to a financial transaction, we need authentication. Since I don't
    understand the difference between 'create order' and 'update order', I made
    a few assumptions.
    Anyway, In my revised model, I would take in (in the briefcase): the user
    name, the salt of their password. Two level authentication can be done at
    the checkout stage (confirmation via SMS or another channel)

    Parameters
    ----------
        sAuth_token (string)
        Expiring cryptographic token generated during authentication.
            # Architect's Note:
            # Since the token expires within about 30 minutes, then I believe
            # that AES or triple-DES encryption should be sufficient. The token
            # can be encoded in base-62 (0..9,A..Z,a..z). Going RSA I think
            # would be overkill. However, the RSA option could be open as a
            # future security upgrade. If the traffic is lighter, then a simple
            # random number could be implemented.

    Example of correct use
    ------
    The dictionaries are written across multiple lines to highlight their
    structure.

    >>> dBriefcase = {
        "sBasket_code": "sA13Qeqx",
        "sAuth_token": "8zQ74sSawCfWza05",

def list_orders(sBasket_code):
    """Gives customer access to the items in their 'basket'.

    Returns a structure which includes all the items which the customer intends
    to purchase. This is the net result of 'update_order' and 'delete_order'

    Parameters
    -------
    sBasket_code (string)

        Single-use cryptographic code which joins items purchased with the
        purchaser

            # Architect's Note: I try not to repeat definitions which were used
            # in a previous field. From experience, it is always helpful to have
            # multiple definitions of a certain item. Also, not every person's
            # English is good. Alternative descriptions will assist in a better
            # understanding of the concept.

    Returns - Valid data:
    -------
    A dictionary is returned containing key-value pairs. However, the structure
    for valid data is different from error notification. The 'sStatus' key is
    common to both 'valid data' and 'error' returns. It determines the further
    structure of the response\n
    Architect's Note: I have omitted the sub-total and the delivery fee. The
    decision is left to "business rules" if this data should be included at this
    stage. Also, the frontend would be able to do this calculation.
